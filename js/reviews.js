    content: `I've always enjoyed Rummikub, and I've started playing it again recently. I understand waiting between turns and taking time during my own turn. My wife and I use a 3-minute timer to keep things moving. Playing online with a free app helps reset the game. When I played in person a few times, it was frustrating to redo a tricky move that didn't go well.`,
