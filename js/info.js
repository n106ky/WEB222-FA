Mr. Ephraim Hertzano, who used to sell toothbrushes, plastic items, and cosmetics, came up with a brilliant idea for a game while living in Romania under the Communist regime, where card games were banned.
  Mr. Hertzano wanted to create a game that could be enjoyed by people of all ages and backgrounds, using small tiles instead of cards. He aimed to bring people together and revolutionize leisure time worldwide. He named this game Rummikub. With a bright and ambitious vision, the game quickly gained popularity.
  After World War II, the Hertzano family moved to Israel, where they continued developing Rummikub. They worked on it in the backyard of their home in Bat Yam and eventually became professional game developers after successfully launching it in the market.
  <br><br> Over the years, Rummikub has become a household name, recognized and enjoyed by generations across the globe. Its ability to bridge language and cultural barriers has made it a universal pastime. The game's legacy continues as it remains a staple in family gatherings, social events, and gaming communities.<br>`;

  <ul>
  <li><b>#1. Use the Joker Wisely: </b>Only get rid of the joker when you can win. This stops others from benefiting from your joker.</li>
  <li><b>#2. Make a Fun Mistake: </b>Sometimes, do something wrong on purpose and finish your turn. As a punishment, pick three extra cards. This gives you more choices for your next turn.</li>
  <li><b>#3. Joker Strategy: </b>If you have a joker and a similar tile, use the joker after swapping it. If a card is on the board twice, throw it away. This way, others can't use the joker advantage.</li>
  <li><b>#4. Locking Tiles: </b>You can't remove tiles from a meld with a joker, but you can lock tiles to stop others from using them together. This is a great tip.</li>
  <li><b>#5. Three Tile Trick: </b>Try not to add tiles to groups that are already there. Instead, use your tiles in groups of three. It's harder for others to match three tiles.</li>
  <li><b>#6. Save Some Moves: </b>Don't use all your moves at once. Play one and save the others for later. This way, you won't need to remove more tiles.</li>
  <li><b>#7. Swap with the Joker: </b>If you have a tile like the joker, switch it with the joker. This lets you use the joker somewhere else.</li>
  <li><b>#8. Smart Joker Use: </b>If you're losing, use the joker in your hand. It can be worth 30 points. So, use the jokers early. Others might use them, giving you more choices.</li>
