      In Hong Kong, we used to call Rummikub as "gwuai-lo mahjong", where gwuai-lo means "foreigner".

      <br><br>I was introduced to this game when I was 12 years old. 
      And guess what? I still play it on my smartphone today. 
      I used to play it a lot, staying up late just to earn more Rummikub coins.
      
      <br><br>People say playing board games can bring people together, and this game is a perfect example. 
      It's easy to understand, so anyone, no matter how old or where they're from, can enjoy it. It's also good for making your brain sharper and improving your memory.

      <br><br>There was a time my family wasn't getting along too well. 
      So, I got this game from an online store and introduced it to them. 
      Even though we only had three players (it's best with four), my dad, mom, and I had a blast playing together. 
      It really improved our relationship. Sad thing is, I couldn't always accompany with my family.
      So I introduced them to play it online with other players!
      
      <br><br>Since then, my mom got addicted too. 
      She plays the online version and even wins more Rummikub coins than I do!
      One time, when she was having a gathering with her friends, she brought Rummikub with her and introduced to her friends. Do I foresee that happening?
