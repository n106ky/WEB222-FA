            Rummikub is a tile-based game, combining elements of the card game
            Rummy and mahjong. Every turn you can use your tiles or take a new
            one from the tile pool to make either Groups or Runs. Groups are
            formed by at least 3 tiles with the same number, but different
            colors. Runs consist in at least 3 tiles of the same color and with
            consecutive numbers. Unique for Rummikub is that players can work
            with the tiles that have already been played.<br>

            <br /><br />The game consists of 106 tiles in four different colors
            (black, red, blue, and yellow) and two jokers. Players start with a
            hand of tiles and take turns drawing and discarding tiles in order
            to form valid sets and runs. Players can manipulate existing melds
            on the table, rearranging tiles to create new combinations. A key
            rule is that players must always maintain a certain minimum value of
            points in their initial meld, which adds an additional layer of
            strategy to the game. The goal is to be the first to eliminate all
            the tiles from their rack. The players must puzzle out their best
            combinations and when more tiles are in play, the options becomes
            challenging and complex.
            <br><br>For now, Rummikub even have the mobile version and you can enjoy the game anytime, anywhere for free!
            <br><br>Let's gather some friends and have fun!
